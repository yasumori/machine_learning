# Machine Learning in Python

These days deep neural networks (DNNs) dominate the field of natural language processing and speech processing.

I believe that learning non DNN machine learning still brings some benefits to my life.

This repository is dedicated to my implementation of machine learning algorithms.

## Structure

- **code** stores machine learning code

- **tests** unit tests for machine learning code

- **demo** demo for machine learning code

---

## ML algorithms

- **gaussian_mixture_model** (GMM)

- **hidden_markov_model** (HMM)

- **k_means**

- **linear_regression**

- **logistic_regression**

- **naive_bayes**

## TODOs

- More LMs - SVM and Decision Tree

- naive_bayes: implement smoothing mechanism

- naive_bayes: implement Gaussian naive Bayes for continuous data

- k_means: add visualization of clusters for demo

- hidden_markov_model: change probabilities to log scale

- hidden_markov_model: add demo
